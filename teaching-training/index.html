		<section class="intro">
			<p>I've been teaching technical and creative skills for over two decades — from formal curriculum at a community college to leading a 400+ member Blender user group in Salt Lake City. Whether it's onboarding a team to new tools, designing a training program from scratch, or running a hands-on workshop, I make complex technical material approachable without dumbing it down.</p>
